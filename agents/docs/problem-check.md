# Problem Check — is the question even the right question?

> **What this is:** a drop-in lens for reading a live, partial problem discussion. It does **not** summarize or solve — it audits the *problem's framing and standing*: what's being asked vs. actually worked on, what's being **conflated**, what's **thin**, what's **off**.
>
> **How it fits the investigation method:** the method grounds *downward* (Step 1 — show me the instance) and *upward* (Steps 2/5 — does it solve the class). This grounds a third way — *inward*: is this one, well-defined, well-supported question, or several tangled together? Its highest-value output is **conflation detection** — and usually it's not a single merge but a *list* of distinct problems treated as one, which then split into separate branches. It is the concrete mechanism behind the "identify uncertainties" need flagged in [investigation-question-coverage.md](./investigation-question-coverage.md).
>
> **When to run it:** **every investigation** — it's wired into the method's Step 1 (collect the raw facts), not gated behind a trigger. On a crisp, single-problem request the flags will mostly come back "nothing here," and that's fine (fast when there's nothing to find). Its value spikes when a request bundles several things, when "asked" and "answered" have drifted, or when a term / "what does solved look like" is undefined — and it's strongest on a transcript or live discussion, where you *also* extract the explicit decisions.

## The prompt (verbatim)

```
**Problem Check** — Injected mid-discussion. You're reading a live, partial transcript of people working a problem. Don't summarize it, don't solve it. Answer the questions below about the *problem itself* — its framing and standing.

Rules for every answer:
- A question may be answered "nothing here." Never manufacture a finding to look useful.
- Every claim cites the words that justify it. A claim you can't ground, you drop.
- Plain register: no scare quotes around the team's words, no intensifiers (massive, critical, impossible), no invented terms. Use their plain language, not a sharpened version.
- Treat the transcript as live and noisy — partial, possibly mislabeled speakers. Anchor on the active thread, not the whole meeting. The last thing said isn't necessarily the point.

THE QUESTION
1. **Asked** — What problem does the group *say* it's working on?
2. **Answered** — What is the discussion *actually* working on? If it differs from Asked, name the drift.
3. **Should-ask** — Is there a sharper or more upstream question that would serve them better? If the asked question is the right one, say so.

THE FLAGS — raise only what's present; "nothing here" is valid for all three.
4. **Conflation** — Are two+ distinct problems being treated as one? Name them apart; say whether solving one would even touch the other.
5. **Thin** — Any key term undefined, any "what does solved look like" unstated, any claim with no support? Name the specific gap, not "needs detail."
6. **Off** — Does anything fail to track with the rest — a claim that contradicts another, or an assumption that doesn't hold given what else was said? (Internal inconsistency only — you can't catch factual errors against the world.)

FORMATTING — keep all six findings and their evidence. The goal is a fast top-down scan: each finding is a "### " section heading followed by its own two-column table.
- Above each table, print the section name as a heading: "### Asked", "### Answered", etc.
- The table has a blank header row "|  |  |", then the separator "|---|---|", then one row per labeled line. (No column titles — keep it quiet.)
    **finding** — the claim, one plain clause. (Always present.)
    **drift** — Answered only: "[what they think they're asking]" → "[what they're actually doing]"
    **consequence** — Conflation / Off only: the second thought, the valuable half.
    **why** — Should-ask only: one line on what the better question decides.
    **evidence** — the supporting quote, TRIMMED to the 5–10 words that prove it. Never paste a full rambling quote.
- Row order: finding → (drift / consequence / why) → evidence. Omit any row you have nothing for.
- Group under two headers: "## The question" (Asked, Answered, Should-ask) and "## Flags" (Conflation, Thin, Off).
- If all three flags are clear, under Flags print only: "No flags — the question being answered is the one being asked."

Layout:

## In brief
A 2–3 sentence plain-language sketch of what the discussion is about and where it currently stands — just enough to orient a reader before the findings. This is the one place you describe rather than diagnose: no flags, no drift, no quotes. Neutral and factual.

# The question

| **finding** | [the sharper question] |
| **why** | [what it decides] |

# Flags
---
### Conflation
|  |  |
|---|---|
| **finding** | [two problems, named apart] |
| **consequence** | [whether solving one touches the other] |
